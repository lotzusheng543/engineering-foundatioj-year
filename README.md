ðŸš¤ Riverboat Simulator â€“ Foundation Year Python Group Project
This project is a Python-based simulation developed during our Foundation Year at University of Southampton Malaysia. The main focus is to model and visualize how a boat crosses a river under various flow conditions using principles of vectors and projectile motion.

ðŸ§  Background
Inspired by challenges in maritime navigation, the simulator aims to help usersâ€”especially new engineering studentsâ€”understand how a boat's trajectory is influenced by both its own velocity and the riverâ€™s current. This project combines real-world logic with fundamental physics concepts like:

Vector addition

Right-angle trigonometry

Projectile motion without air resistance

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
Simulate riverboat motion affected by flow speed, direction, and angle.

Calculate and visualize total velocity, time to cross, and downstream displacement.

Offer an interactive and educational interface to strengthen understanding of vectors in motion.

ðŸ–¥ Features
Adjustable parameters: river width, flow speed, boat speed, and angle.

Velocity vector visualization.

Challenge mode with target landing points.

Help screen and tooltips for guidance.

ðŸ‘¥ Team
This was a collaborative group project by 5 students (Team 9), and included:

UI/UX design (storyboards, personas)

Physics implementation

Python programming

Team progress tracking (burndown chart)

ðŸ“š Skills Used
